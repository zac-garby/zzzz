-- TODO: It's pretty stupid to
-- have abstraction parameters as generic 'Term's. There should be
-- a type representing names with subscripts, maybe Name, which stores
-- a string and an integer.

-- TODO: Application doesn't reduce properly. For example,
--     ((λx.(λy.x+y)) 1) 2
-- doesn't reduce (i.e. an error) because the top-level term is an application
-- of ((λx.(λy.x+y)) 1) to the number 2. However, application currently expects the
-- function to be applied to be in WHNF already (i.e. it is a λ-abstraction), but
-- this won't be the case in almost all situations.
--
-- I'm not sure how this is usually solved, but one solution might be to β-reduce the
-- function in an application to WHNF before reducing the application. Would this
-- preserve lazyness?
